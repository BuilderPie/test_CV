I am interested in the cybersecurity and safety of connected and automated vehicles and how those emergent properties can influence mobility services by future transportation systems.

My research activities include identifying cyber threats and designing strategies and solutions to mitigate them. First, I develop threat modeling techniques based on graphical (e.g., attack trees) and control-theoretic models (STPA/STAMP) to help engineers evaluate high-risk cyber threats under dynamic attacker's model. Second, I have been exploring the detection of malicious behaviors in vehicular networks and the decision-making under adversarial environment. Third, I am developing robust sensing technologies to protect on-board sensors from being hacked such as Lidar spoofing or scenery attacks.

I had been working with both the safety and cybersecurity teams at Ford Motor Company.

Specialties: Threat modeling, Hazard analysis, Security and privacy of VANET, Machine Learning, SysML.
